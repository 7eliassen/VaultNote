VaultNote is a full-stack application (FastAPI | React) for taking notes with client-side encryption, which I am developing for learning purposes.
So far, I have finished only the basic functionality without note encryption.

In the future (maybe) I will add:
- Note encryption
- Formatting notes in Markdown
