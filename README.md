VaultNote is a full-stack application (FastAPI | React) for taking notes with client-side encryption, which I am developing for learning purposes.
So far, I have finished only the basic functionality without note encryption.

At the moment, the app has the following functionality:
- User registration and login
- Storing, deleting, creating, and editing notes, searching notes, and auto-saving notes

In the future (maybe) I will add:
- Note encryption
- Formatting notes in Markdown
